# bayton_v6 & 11ty

Yet another bayton theme template

This one is all about whitespace, openness, and simplicity. Tying in a new brand identity at the same time. A lot of style is pulled over from v5 but without all of the bloat.

This site automatically builds to CF pages on commit, and can be accessed publicly here - https://dev.bayton.org/

Or build locally as desired.
