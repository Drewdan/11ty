[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7d5c5418-3a52-4195-82ff-383ae41d4891/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/bayton/deploys)

The 6th major iteration of the BAYTON design. This latest theme is all about white space, openness, and simplicity. Tying in a new brand identity at the same time. A lot of style is pulled over from v5 (never made it out of beta) but without all of the bloat.

This site automatically builds to netlify on commit, and can be accessed publicly here - https://bayton.org/
