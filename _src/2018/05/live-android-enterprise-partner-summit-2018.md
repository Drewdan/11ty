May 8th marks the first day of the [Android Enterprise Partner Summit](https://events.withgoogle.com/android-enterprise-summit-2018), offering attendees a wide array of talks, demos, and information across two dedicated tracks (technical &amp; go to market).

Given the success of 2017’s summit (see reference for that [here](https://youtu.be/ADlMHFdmXKU?list=PLOcMSsuppV4qUrw9bv_YXGsXuAIzRUiQf)) I’m super excited to be attending.

As a bit of an experiment and a first of its kind for the site, I’m going to be live-blogging the event (not religiously, but certainly highlights) throughout day one and two. The feed for that is below!

For live updates without refreshing the page and to get involved with questions or comments, head on over to the [Discuss topic](https://discuss.bayton.org/t/live-android-enterprise-partner-summit-2018/126). I’ll do my best to direct questions to the right people or answer accordingly!

Want to get in touch via other means? I’ll be on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jasonbayton) throughout the event also.
