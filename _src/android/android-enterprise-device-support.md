### No longer maintained

 While I am still actively testing devices, I no longer publish them here. Consider the below to be historical, including the advanced testing, and not to be taken as current status of a device. If you’d like your devices tested against Android Enterprise functionality, feel free to get in touch. </div>
 
 The devices listed below have been tested against a current, Android Enterprise-compatible Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) platform for one or more of the following:

- Android Enterprise work profile
- Android Enterprise fully managed (work-managed)
- Android Enterprise work profile on a fully managed device (COPE/COMP)
- Android Enterprise dedicated (COSU or kiosk)
- Multiple provisioning methods, including [zero-touch enrolment](/android/what-is-android-zero-touch-enrolment/)

<div class="callout callout-info">

### OEM or reseller?

I welcome additional devices for testing! If you’re an **OEM** or **reseller** of Android devices, you can join **Sony**, **Nokia**, **Huawei** and others in lending me anything from Android 6.0.1 or later to independently test. This is a free service, devices can be returned within a week or so. Use my [contact](/contact/) page to get in touch or [email me directly](mailto:jason@bayton.org).

For more information on what’s involved in testing, please head to: [Android Enterprise independent validation process and information](/android/android-enterprise-device-support/validation-process-and-information/).

</div>

Advanced testing
----------------

The following devices have undergone advanced testing. Introduced in June 2019, advanced testing follows the same [process](/android/android-enterprise-device-support/validation-process-and-information/) as standard testing, but each individual restriction/function is documented and verified irrespective of outcome across at least two EMMs.

A report containing 700+ touch points is provided to the OEM on completion along with any recommendations.

- [Google Pixel 3a Android Enterprise validation report](/android/android-enterprise-device-support/google-pixel-3a-validation-report/)
- [Moto G7 Power Android Enterprise validation report](/android/android-enterprise-device-support/moto-g7-power-android-enterprise-validation-report/)
- [Sony Xperia L3 Android Enterprise validation report](/android/android-enterprise-device-support/sony-xperia-l3-android-enterprise-validation-report/)

## Standard testing

Previously listed devices here have been removed. Refer to the advanced tested devices to understand the testing undertaken in validating AE compatibility, and if interested you may [contact me](/contact) to discuss testing your Android device at no cost.
