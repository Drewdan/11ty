Google has recently patched a known and exploited vulnerability in V8. According to [NIST](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0519):

> Out of bounds memory access in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 120.0.6099.224 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: High)

NIST: [https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0519](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0519)

Chrome for Android release:

Chrome for desktop release:

This is patched as of Chrome for Android version **120.0.6099.230**.

## Recommended actions

It is not stated how this vulnerability directly impacts Android devices, however Chrome for Android does incorporate the patches released prior to the desktop versions, and is therefore reasonable to err on the side of caution.

Due to the nature of the vulnerability, it is recommended EMM admins set Chrome for Android (or equivalent Chromium-based alternatives) app update policy to high priority. In AMAPI this is done but setting `AutoUpdateMode` to `AUTO_UPDATE_HIGH_PRIORITY`, but as labels in EMM platforms are inconsistent, look for settings within an assigned app to set an app specific update mode. 

Alternatively, you may consider applying a `minimumVersionCode` policy with the version `609923133`, corresponding to version 120.0.6099.231 (a version above that which is patched) however be aware Chrome version codes vary, per Google:

> Different build variants of Chrome for Android have different version codes
>
> _[via](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/build/util/android_chrome_version.py)_

Ensure appropriate testing is undertaken if choosing to use a version code policy, and be aware it is a highly disruptive policy that will prevent device use until the app is updated.
