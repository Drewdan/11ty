A collection of DPC extras for various EMM/UEM vendors can be found here: [Android Enterprise zero-touch DPC extras collection](/android/android-enterprise-zero-touch-dpc-extras-collection/).

As EMM vendors begin supporting the zero-touch iFrame introduced in late 2020, manual editing of DPC extras should diminish as EMMs will handle it automatically.
