As of late 2020, all GMS certified Android 9.0+ devices from all OEMs support zero-touch.

OEMs supporting zero-touch on 8.0/8.1 include:

- Sony
- Huawei
- HMD Global
- Google
- LG
- Motorola
- Sharp

Along with the change to globally support all Android 9.0+ GMS certified devices with the integration of zero-touch into GMS Core (Google Play Services), the previous Google-maintained list of zero-touch supported devices, including those running older Android versions, is no longer live.
