No. 

App shortcuts supported with device admin are not available for Android Enterprise. Instead, itâ€™s possible to deploy shortcuts for Android Enterprise devices as web applications through the Google Play iFrame.

Instead of a bookmark/shortcut that opens in the default browser, web apps are legitimate applications that open with Google Chrome.
