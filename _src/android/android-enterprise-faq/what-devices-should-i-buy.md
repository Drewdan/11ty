This question comes up often and isn’t always simple to answer.

Organisations ideally need to understand the use case for the devices to be selected. This could be normal knowledge worker devices for employees needing a corporate phone, something tough (doesn’t need to be rugged) to withstand harsher environments, or something bespoke such as a kiosk on a reception desk used for checking in or something with an integrated printer/scanner.

After this, the minimum OS required for what the organisation wants to do, for example setting a passcode on a work profile (a *challenge*) requires Android 7.0, ensuring that passcode cannot be the same as the device passcode requires 9.0. More of these comparisons are made in [considerations when migrating from device administrator to Android Enterprise](/android/considerations-when-migrating-from-device-administrator-to-android-enterprise/).

Once determined, the best place to start looking is the [Android Enterprise Recommended list](https://androidenterprisepartners.withgoogle.com/devices/#!?AER). If nothing suits requirements, get in touch and I’ll try to help out!
