The term “zero-touch” is aimed at admins and IT teams that no longer need to manually touch each device in order to undertake managed provisioning. This is in context of IT teams often pre-staging devices before shipping them to end users to avoid non-enrolment, which is no longer needed when devices are zero-touch registered.

It does *not* apply to the act of end-users running through the provisioning process, which has admittedly required more and more taps over the last few major Android versions due in part to the often unnecessary interruptions of unskippable privacy prompts.
