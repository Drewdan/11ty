When deploying the iFrame, a UEM vendor decides what they wish to support. On that basis, the iFrame may lack private app upload, web app creation or bundle support.

It’s possible for a UEM to implement multiple iFrames with these features separated out, so is worth checking this functionality isn’t placed elsewhere on the console.

Should additional features not be available anywhere, please get in touch with your UEM provider to discuss this.
