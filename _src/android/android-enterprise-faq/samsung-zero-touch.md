As of late 2020 [yes](/2020/11/google-announce-big-changes-to-zero-touch/)!

As zero-touch is a little light on features, Knox Mobile Enrolment has full support for Android Enterprise and a little more control over the how and when for device provisioning, so organisations may still opt not to use zero-touch on a Samsung device.

Through supported EMMs and the minimum Knox version (2.9), organisations can use either KME or zero-touch (9.0+) to deploy an Android Enterprise fully managed, dedicated, or COPE device, or work profile via KME only.
