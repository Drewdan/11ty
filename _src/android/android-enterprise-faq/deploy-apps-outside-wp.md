No. 

It is not possible to deploy applications into the parent profile (or, the device outside of the work profile) in a work profile deployment. This is covered, as well as other aspects of this use case, with [considerations when deploying MTD with Android Enterprise](/android/mtd-and-android-enterprise/)

As of Android 11 this answer also applies to COPE, work profiles on company owned devices.
