In Android 13, Google is introducing a new runtime permission for app notifications. 

## Whatâ€™s changing

Prior to Android 13, app notifications are not individually managed. Users can opt to disable notifications per-app as desired, but from a management perspective, the options are limited to globally reducing notification visibility with changes to the notification bar config, or leaving users to handle this themselves.

## Will this have any impact on EMM-deployed app notifications?
