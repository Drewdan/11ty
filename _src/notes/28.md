AMAPI RELEASE NOTES ARE UP!
Count: 6 months & 21 days after the last update in December :)

[https://developers.google.com/android/management/release-notes](https://developers.google.com/android/management/release-notes)

- Added support for the DomainSuffixMatch field in Open Network Configuration to configure enterprise Wi-Fi networks for Android 6+. Enterprise Wi-Fi configurations without DomainSuffixMatch are considered insecure and will be rejected by the platform.
- Added UsbDataAccess policy setting that allows admins to fully disable USB data transferring. usbFileTransferDisabled is now deprecated, please use UsbDataAccess.

EAP is a hot-topic at the moment, since either the May GPSU or June SPL has been causing a significant number of EAP policy failures following enforcement of the domain field (I found commits in both that could be related, but nothing concrete).

I guess we won't get retrospective release notes for everything up to June though?

My AMAPI tracker has been reset, either way - ðŸ”— [https://bayton.org/amapi-tracker](https://bayton.org/amapi-tracker)
