FYI, there are multiple reports on the Android Enterprise Help Community ([https://support.google.com/work/android/community?hl=en&sjid=8020794700293409791-EU](https://support.google.com/work/android/community?hl=en&sjid=8020794700293409791-EU)) as well as reseller partner community of zero-touch enrolment issues at the moment. 

If you see the error "Zero-touch isn't available", it's not just you. 

Google haven't (that I can see) acknowledged it just yet, but it's been logged so should hopefully be resolved soon.

Edit: 

Confirmed (11am GMT+1) Google are working on it.

Edit2: 

Google state it is now resolved (~7pm GMT+1)
