A question popped up on the Help Community yesterday asking how one might change the Google account associated with their EMM bind.

For years this wasn't possible, so it was exceptionally important you didn't use an account you didn't want to be tied to for any extended period of time, as well as obviously ensuring it was a company-owned Google account and not Bob's personal account he'd take with him into retirement.

More recently however, a permissions system akin to that we find in zero-touch and other solutions has been implemented, allowing multiple accounts to now manage the bind complete with basic user permissions. 

I popped a FAQ together to address it:

Happy Saturday!
