Another quick note to cover off a gap in documentation, much like the whitelisted domains in Google Workspace I posted about some weeks back.. 

If you're trying to block a selection of URLs in Chrome managed config and find it's not working, add brackets:

`[‚Äúhttp://www.bbc.co.uk‚Äù, ‚Äúfacebook.com‚Äù, ".example.com/?etc"]`

It had completely slipped my mind brackets were needed with some EMMs when I was configuring this yesterday, and Google's documentation makes no mention of it. Everything else on that page regarding formatting and URL examples is valuable, though :)
