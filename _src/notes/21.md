There's an issue today with both AMAPI and PlayEMM API vendors struggling with application installs. 

It appears applications set to either REQUIRED_FOR_SETUP or FORCE_INSTALLED are not installing. 

In some cases this simply means the app doesn't silently install, but it may be present in managed Google Play for end users to install themselves manually, however for EMMs that lean on REQUIRED_FOR_SETUP specifically, this can delay or prevent enrolment of devices all together.

Google are on it, so it's a matter of time, but until they confirm a fix this'll likely have far-reaching impacts for Android Enterprise deployments.

For those with access to the EMM Partner Community, here's the link to the issue: https://emm.androidenterprise.dev/s/feed/0D55G00007stRMnSAM
