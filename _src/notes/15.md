For those who don't know, I spend my working hours building an AMAPI based EMM with a small dedicated team of folks across the world.

My biggest gripe, after the ever-present lack of functionality compared to PlayEMM/on-device APIs (that hopefully extensibility will fix one day), is the absence of release notes since last year.

It is such a pain having to sift through the public docs manually before each cycle looking for new or updated (or deprecated!) functionality.. and it shouldn't be the case for such a critial solution.

So obviously, I've started a tracker:

[https://bayton.org/amapi-tracker](https://bayton.org/amapi-tracker)

It solves nothing of course, but hopefully highlights the issue enough that Google will sort it out üòÅ
