If you haven't heard, the Android Enterprise Help Community is evolving ðŸŽ‰

From the end of June, the old community will go read-only for new questions. Instead, customers and partners alike are invited to join the new customer community, [androidenterprise.community](https://www.androidenterprise.community).

The new community boasts better separation of topics with dedicated sub-forums, a more flexible & inclusive layout catering to a wider array of content types, private messaging, and much more. 

With almost 300 recommended answers and 700 replies to community questions over the last few years, I'm proud of the contributions I've been able to make in the Help Community, and look forward to continuing to support customers and peers as the new community gets up and running.

Check it out, get registered, and say hello :) - ðŸ”— [https://www.androidenterprise.community](https://www.androidenterprise.community)
