LinkedIn's collaborative articles are a great idea, but not very well executed IMO.

If I don't go actively looking for them, I don't see them. 

If I want to contribute to one, I have to manually browse through all the topics until I find it. 

LinkedIn sent me a mail t'other day asking to do more of/with them, which I'd like to on particular topics, but the barrier for entry ATM outweighs my enthusiasm.

With better UX these would be a really nice, easy way of building excellent community articles that are always current and relevant, so I'd like to see this improved.
