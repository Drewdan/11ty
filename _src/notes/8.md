Way back in 2018 I was gifted a drone through work. a decent one at the time for someone who'd never touched a drone before, and I was excited to use it!

Except I never did. I charged everything up ready to go and popped it in the cupboard for a sunny day, and subsequently forgot about it until my spring clean this weekend. 

Luckily one(!) of the batteries worked and after a quick registration with the CAA, kiddo and I had an absolute blast with it all weekend. 

So much so in fact I got an itch and picked up a Mini 3 Pro today to compare the tech, and honestly I'm blown away. 

This picture it captured of my neighbourhood is ðŸ”¥

To pivot back to my regularly scheduled programming, the remote controller I got with it runs Android, AOSP naturally for the use case here. It wasn't clear until a familiar chime played on boot and I'm going to dig into what and how it's running once the "new shiny" feeling wears off a bit.

I look forward to going places and capturing some of the imagery I've only seen on TV for myself ðŸ˜Ž
