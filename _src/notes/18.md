I'm aware of a few 404's across the website at the moment, this is mostly due to reorganising content from the old tags (getting started, diving deeper, resources, etc) to a new suite of tags that better align with Android Enterprise terminology. 

Until I'm finished, you'll see some tags (like [fully managed](/tags/fully-managed)) show blank/404. 

I'm working on it.

In the interim, if you're looking for something that isn't where it used to be (I'll fix redirects, too) then jump over to [full-text search](/search) and you'll find it quick as a flash.
