I've shared this previously, but now I have a document covering it!

ðŸ”— Application min target API: [https://bayton.org/android/android-14-minimum-sdk](https://bayton.org/android/android-14-minimum-sdk)

With platform stability achieved and general availability just around the corner, be mindful that for the first time in Android 14, applications targeting very old versions of Android (6.0) will no longer install, and there's no API or exception to this policy. 

If you're running legacy Android apps, or even modern apps that target less than API 23 (6.0) for a particular reason or another (presumably avoiding newer restrictions that come with targeting newer versions of Android?) you will need to update them to guarantee they'll continue to be useful on your Android 14 fleet, as and when it gets up to that version.
