One of the most significant changes planned for Android 14 was the adjustment of the work profile to never fully turn off; it was going to leverage functionality not dissimilar to do not disturb and work towards ending notification-geddon for when the work profile has been off for a while, where *everything* comes through all at once upon turning it back on.

It didn't ultimately make the cut, (see [https://bayton.org/blog/2023/09/work-profile-reverted-in-14/](https://bayton.org/blog/2023/09/work-profile-reverted-in-14/)), and for good reason from what I recall. Issues around notifications when the profile was "off" were publicly documented.

Anyway, I thought I'd take a little peek at the 15 beta and, unfortunately, it doesn't look like work profile changes are on the agenda yet (if at all); I see the same pre-14 behaviour (Status: Shutdown/-1) when turning the profile off:

```bash
jasonbayton@Jasons-MacBook-Pro platform-tools % ./adb shell dumpsys user | grep -A 3 "Work profile"
  UserInfo{10:Work profile:1030} serialNo=10 isPrimary=false parentId=0
    Type: android.os.usertype.profile.MANAGED
    Flags: 4144 (INITIALIZED|MANAGED_PROFILE|PROFILE)
    State: RUNNING_UNLOCKED
jasonbayton@Jasons-MacBook-Pro platform-tools % ./adb shell dumpsys user | grep -A 3 "Work profile"
  UserInfo{10:Work profile:10b0} serialNo=10 isPrimary=false parentId=0
    Type: android.os.usertype.profile.MANAGED
    Flags: 4272 (INITIALIZED|MANAGED_PROFILE|PROFILE|QUIET_MODE)
    State: -1
```
It's something I'll keep my eye on, but in the shorter term Google introduced a notification cooldown in DP1, later removed in Beta 1, that will hopefully return and potentially land a middle-ground on maintaining the existing fully-off behaviour of profiles, while not overwhelming users with notifications when eventually turned on once more. 

No idea why it was removed between builds, but another one to keep an eye on.

(BTW, a beta 1.1 is available with critical fixes, if you're interested - [https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/release-notes](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/release-notes))
