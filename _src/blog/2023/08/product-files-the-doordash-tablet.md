Welcome to Product Files, a series of articles that touch on some of the more interesting aspects of running a product organisation for the last several years.

As this series grows, additional links will show up here:

- [Alternative form factors and power solutions](/blog/2023/05/product-files-alternate-formfactors-and-power-solutions/)

Google [recently published a blog post](https://blog.google/products/android-enterprise/android-tablets-doordash/) by the DoorDash team that covered how the T8, supported by Android Enterprise's suite of management solutions, provided some pretty respectable achievements for them:

With these in mind, I thought I'd take some time in this article to dive a little deeper into the product development of the RHINO T8 and some of the product decisions I made during the development of the tablet that ultimately made it attractive to DoorDash, becoming one of their most-deployed units today.

As I delve into some of the finer details of T8 development, I'd like you to keep in mind this is a 2019 device. Some of the features that made it special at the time are simply par for the course in 2023 with many manufacturers. That said, I'm proud of the decisions made early on in development that got it to where it is today.

## What is the RHINO T8?

I touched on the T8 back in 2020 with my [Building Android devices](/blog/2020/12/on-building-android-devices/) article. I'd recommend you take a gander at that if you haven't as I provided a good deal of relevant information as to where RHINO came from and the longer-term plans for the brand and ecosystem.

That said, here's the T8:

It looks, behaves, and mounts like a standard 8" tablet available from many OEMs in the market today, and _especially today_ in fact, as the ecosystem has filled to the brim with tablets in the last couple of years; far more so than in 2019 when the T8 project kicked off.
