<span class="orange">A</span>s many of your reading this will know, I've been in the Enterprise Mobility Ecosystem for a very long time.

10 years, in fact, as of January just gone.

Although I started as a generalist, supporting Android, iOS, Windows Mobile (loved those CAB files), Blackberry.. it's quite clear at this <span class="orange">p</span>oint where I chose to hang my hat and invest my time & effort. 

And it's paid off. Today I'm a well-known guy in the space, interacting with peers around the world on an almost daily basis to help with Android <span class="orange">r</span>elated issues. I've achieved great things with the Android Enterprise Help Community, various partner accolades, I contribute to successful mobility groups and organisations, and I've had the honour of working closely with Google on several initiatives in the last few years.

<span class="orange">I</span>n my own career since, it feels like I've touched almost every aspect of the Android ecosystem; I've done support, consulting, product management, project management, programme management, (technical) marketing, advocacy, strategy, engineering, and I've done this broadly across most of the segments of the industry - carrier, MSP, OEM, EMM, private organisations, maybe more.. and that doesn't take into account those I've helped in my off-hours. 

My humble website, here, is what I have to thank for where I am right now though. A right-time, right-place decision to start documenting my journey with Android for Work way back when at a time where Google had <span class="orange">l</span>ittle time and resource to do a considerable amount themselves gave me a real leg-up even on their own documentation and resources for organisations, and they rest, as they say, is history. 

I've been thinking a lot about this recently, and it's become apparent nothing I've achieved in my 10 years of Enterprise Mobility has given me quite the <span class="orange">f</span>ulfilment and sense of pride as much as being able to help organisations - individuals, even - find their <span class="orange">o</span>wn path into the ecosystem with the docs and resources I've poured my evenings and weekends into for so long.

But still more can be done. 

Folks coming into the ecosystem rarely do so intentionally; filling a generalist role between industries is the norm, from which a passion for Enterprise Mobility starts to grow. I'm no different, I was doing compliance and system administration before I got the <span class="orange">o</span>pportunity to bring my passion for Android to the workplace - again, right-place, right-time. I don't think I can say I know anyone who <span class="orange">l</span>eft education with the intention of a career in mobility.

I want to change that.

I think it is primarily a problem of visibility; I ask my <span class="orange">S</span>on occasionally for example what he wants to be when he grows up, and like many other children it's typically Policeman, Fireman, Pilot, Doctor, Teacher.. roles that take a prominent, visible position in society. 

To address this, I am introducing **Mini Mobility: Modern Mobile Management for the next generation of Mobility Experts**

With this new venture, I am taking my decade of Enterprise Mobility expertise combined with my unique ability to adapt the most complex of topics to any audience, and creating a series of educational books for children that will expose them early on to the Enterprise Mobility ecosystem. 

## Daddy's Phone Can't Do That!

My first book in the series, illustrated by the extremely talented [Laila Arêde](https://lailartsy.com), addresses the challenges organisations face with DLP and security management, and introduces the topic through a common situation between child and parent, asking to use their phone.

**Daddy's Phone Can't Do That!** takes the young mind through a journey of discovery of why a corporate phone can't do some of the things personal phones do by default, and explores the topic of Mobile Device Management through the responsibilities of Andy Admin, the IT wizard, and Big Boss Bill, the C-level who _just wants to keep his corporate secrets safe_.

## To come 

This is just the first in this brand new venture, and I look forward to repurposing more of my years of content into high quality education over the coming years.

Are you interested in a printed paperback? With enough interest I'll find a publisher to make that happen. [Let me know!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdeWOEk1RzHZQj6Z5jte05H0vwK5WVMh7f7eZmD9AhQddcm6Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)
