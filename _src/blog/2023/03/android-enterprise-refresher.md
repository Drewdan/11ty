If you're working in a typical organisation, you're probably struggling to keep up with the ever-evolving world of mobile device management. With employees using their personal devices for work and the rapid pace of technological change, it's no wonder that many IT departments are feeling overwhelmed.

That's where Android Enterprise comes in. Android Enterprise is a powerful mobile device management platform that's designed to help organisations of all sizes manage and secure their mobile devices with ease. Whether you're a small business owner or the IT manager of a large enterprise, Android Enterprise has the tools you need to take control of your mobile device ecosystem.

But what exactly is Android Enterprise, and how does it work? In this article, I'll provide a closer look at this industry-leading platform and explore the benefits it can offer your organisation.

## What is Android Enterprise?

I've covered this many times over the years, but [here's a detailed overview](/android/what-is-android-enterprise-and-why-is-it-used/). In summary: 

Android Enterprise is a comprehensive suite of features built into Android that allows organisations to manage and secure their Android devices at scale. Since it's built on top of the Android operating system, it means that it's fully integrated with all the features and functionality that consumer Android users know and love.

With Android Enterprise, organisations can choose how they want to manage their devices, and do so with far more flexibility than alterntative mobile operating systems. Organisations can create separate work profiles on their employees' devices for example, which keeps work data and personal data completely separate and ensures employees can use their personal devices for work without having to worry about their personal information being compromised. On the opposite end of security and control, organisations can completely own and manage every individual facet of the Android OS, and lock it all the way down to a single-use device. Android Enterprise provides the sliding scale of control, security, and privacy features that allow organisations find the perfect configuration for their needs.

## How does Android Enterprise work?

Android Enterprise is designed to be flexible and customisable, so organisations can choose the management approach that works best for them. There are three main management modes available in Android Enterprise:

- Work Profile: In this configuration, an isolated work profile is created on the employee's device. This work profile is completely separate from the user's personal profile, meaning work and personal data are kept entirely apart. Work profile supports both personal ownership (BYOD) and corporate ownership (COPE).
- Fully Managed: In this configuration, the entire device is managed by the organisation. This allows for complete control over the device and all its data and settings. Fully managed devices can be used both as knowledge worker, and dedicated devices (kiosk).

To compliment these deployment types, Android Enterprise offers a range of features and functionality to help organisations manage and secure their devices. These include:

- App management: With Android Enterprise, organisations can manage and silently deploy apps to their employees' devices without the need of adding Google accounts, ensuring that everyone has access to the tools required to get their work done.
- Device security: Android Enterprise offers a range of security features, including encryption, passcode protection, feature restrictions, and remote wipe. This ensures that all devices are secure, even if they're lost or stolen.
- Data protection: With Android Enterprise, organisations can ensure that sensitive data is protected at all times. This includes features like app-level data separation and device-level encryption.

## Why choose Android Enterprise?

There are many reasons why organisations are choosing Android Enterprise as their preferred platform for device management. Here are just a few of the benefits it can offer:

- Seamless integration: Android is the most popular mobile OS in the world, and as enterprise adoption grows, so too do opportunities to integrate solutions. Managed configurations allow remote application configuration, many corporate tools come with complimentary Android apps, and IDP, productivity, communication, and many other corporate tools _just work_ with Android.
- Easy to use: Android is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, since Android Enterprise is baked directly into the platform, the managed experience doesn't feel non-native; even non-technical employees can quickly get up to speed.
- Customisable: Android Enterprise is highly customisable, which means that organisations can choose the management approach that works best for them.
- Scalable: Android Enterprise is designed to work for organisations of all sizes, from small startups to large enterprises.

## Conclusion

Android Enterprise is the future of mobile device management. With its flexible management modes, comprehensive security features and easy-to-use tools, it's the ideal solution for organisations of all sizes. If you're looking for a mobile device management platform that's powerful, customisable and scalable, look no further than Android.
