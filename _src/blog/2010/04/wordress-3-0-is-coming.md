Brilliant, WordPress have finally merged their two platforms – WordPress and WPMU – into one delicious multi-blog package!

[This link](https://www.itworld.com/offbeat/98956/19-weird-real-gadgets-and-gizmos?page=0%2C10&source=ITWNLE_nlt_top10_2010-04-09) explains everything they’re planning, and I’m excited to see the merge happening hopefully fairly soon. I’ve used both WordPress and it’s MultiUser equivalent to a lesser extent but always found having multiple WordPress installations easier than installing WPMU.

At the moment WordPress 3.0 is in Beta, so use it at your own risk is the message portrayed. Though they’re looking for people to report bugs – if you’re interested download it [here](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.0-beta1.zip).

Make sure you follow their instructions, as by default it isn’t set to allow multiple blogs, follow the instructions [here](https://codex.wordpress.org/User:Andrea/Create_A_Network).

Cheers,
