Google are offering us UK folk the option of now switching from @[googlemail.com](https://googlemail.com) to @[gmail.com](https://gmail.com) after finally winning a battle that has been going on since around 2005.

Here is the link to directly change (you need to be logged in!)

Here’s a little known fact:  
Even though we have had @[googlemail.com](https://googlemail.com) addresses until now, “secretly” we’ve also had @[gmail.com](https://gmail.com) addresses, which were simply not shown. If you have the account <firstname.lastname@googlemail.com> and someone sent the mail to <firstname.lastname@gmail.com> you would still get it.

Didn’t know that? Why don’t you try sending a mail to yourself with the alternate address? That includes you @[gmail.com](https://gmail.com) users! Prefer @[googlemail.com](https://googlemail.com)? Then use it! Simply set up a *send mail as* in settings &gt; accounts, follow the on-screen instructions and you can choose which email address you want to send from. It really is that easy.

Enjoy!
