<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">#### **The competition is now closed**

Thank you to everyone who entered. If you won you will be contacted in due course.

</div>*Note: As of 27.05.2016 the rules have been relaxed to make it easier to enter the competition!*

To celebrate my 100th post on bayton.org I’ve teamed up with ElasticHosts, the subject of my [latest review](/2016/05/elastichosts-review/), to provide one lucky reader with **3 months of free hosting** on the ElasticHosts platform.

What you get
============

The winner can select a region of their choice and benefit from the following resources for the entire duration of the promotional period:

- 2000 MHz CPU (VM)
- 1024 MB Memory (VM)
- 2000 MHz CPU (Container)
- 1024 MB Memory (Container)
- 5 GB SSD
- 30 GB Disk
- 1 VLAN
- 1 Firewall
- 1 Static IP (public IPs are provided for all servers via DHCP)
- 10GB data transfer per month

This will allow provisioning of a number of containers, a couple of VMs and the ability to test-drive a vLAN and Firewall. **All completely free for 3 months!**
