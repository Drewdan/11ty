The world of work is constantly changing.

Through my years in various roles, managing and being managed, here are some of the principles I align to:

1. [Remote working & trust](/principles/remote-working/)
2. [CYOD for work](/principles/tech-preferences/)
3. [Taking time off](/principles/time-off/)
4. [Maintaining a healthy work-life balance](/principles/downtime/)
5. [Organisational stability](/principles/org-stability/)
6. [Continuous education](/principles/continuous-education)

I advocate for these principles wherever I go. Occasionally they're overruled by conflicting company culture.
