If you're looking for expert help, I offer consulting services across the whole Android ecosystem, not limited to: 

- Product selection and validation
- EMM deployments, migrations, healthchecks, risk assessments
- Environment troubleshooting & deployment support
- OEM, EMM, MSP subcontracting
- GMS certification 

Whether you're an organisation deploying devices, an EMM integrating the Android Enterprise solution set, an OEM bringing enterprise-first devices to market, or anything else, I can probably help.
