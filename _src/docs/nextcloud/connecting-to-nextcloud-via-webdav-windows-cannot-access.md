Recent updates to Windows 10 have been interfering with my mapped Nextcloud webDAV network folder.

The errors
----------

For existing connections:

For new connections:

The cause
---------

Doing some digging, it would appear a Windows service is to blame:

The fix
-------

The WebClient service needs to be running and, preferably, set to Automatic. However Iâ€™ve noticed with Windows updates this service is infrequently being set to manual and therefore preventing access to new or existing webDAV connections.

By settings Startup type to **Automatic**, the issue will no longer present itself.  
To avoid a reboot, in the above screenshot simply click **Start** to restore the connection immediately.
