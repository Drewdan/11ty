If you’re one of the five people who come here regularly, you’ll have noticed www.bayton.org was down for the last 36 or so hours.  
This is due to the registrar forgetting to renew my domain after I’d paid. There should be no further downtime, and I will be looking to transfer to another registrar sometime in the year.

Sorry for the inconvenience,

Jason
