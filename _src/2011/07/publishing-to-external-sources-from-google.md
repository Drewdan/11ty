Outlined below are a few services you can post to directly from Google+.  
**Please note!** This *will* undoubtedly become outdated as Google+ has a dedicated team working extremely hard on improving every aspect of the service.

With that said, first I’ll show how to set up the environment. You can alter the below to cover any service you choose to use (which accepts updates over email, naturally).

Using a dedicated circle, we can create dedicated contacts that’ll receive emails whenever a post is published to said circle.

Begin by creating a circle. From here we can add an email contact as below:

You’ll have to give the contact a name, but then you’ll be ready to go. Click Create circle:

[![](https://bucket.bayton.uk-lon1.upcloudobjects.com/uploads/2011/07/Screenshot-2.png "Screenshot-2")](https://bucket.bayton.uk-lon1.upcloudobjects.com/uploads/2011/07/Screenshot-2.png)

Voila:

[![](https://bucket.bayton.uk-lon1.upcloudobjects.com/uploads/2011/07/Screenshot-3.png "Screenshot-3")](https://bucket.bayton.uk-lon1.upcloudobjects.com/uploads/2011/07/Screenshot-3.png)

You can now select this circle when creating a new post and, if you check the box to say “Also email X people not yet using Google+”, Google+ will send an email to the email address(es) you have specified:

[![](https://bucket.bayton.uk-lon1.upcloudobjects.com/uploads/2011/07/Screenshot-5.png "Screenshot-5")](https://bucket.bayton.uk-lon1.upcloudobjects.com/uploads/2011/07/Screenshot-5.png)

So what services can you use this with?

Well, any service that allows you to update via email. Any, I’ve found, except Google Buzz as this will only read the subject and not the body of the email!

You can try this with WordPress, Twiitter (<http://tweetymail.com/>) and Facebook (check out posting via email in the mobile site) just to name a few!

Stuck? I’m happy to help..
