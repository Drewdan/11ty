Are you bored of your typical, bog-standard Windows desktop? Yeah, so was I! After a little hunting on the internet I found a solution to my little problem in the form of BumpTop.

BumpTop offers you a full 3D “room” to store your app shortcuts, facebook “wall” (get it? heh!), notes, email etc etc. The icons are rotatable, all 4 walls and floor is cusomizable with your own or a preconfigured background image and the transitions between walls is flawless. There are some minor glitches, but in my case it’s more to do with the poor graphics card on my system.

Now, BumpTop is a 3D overlay of your desktop, that is it’ll mimic what’s on your standard desktop, but is basically a “skin” which floats above everything. In some ways it’s no different to the StyleXP programs which don’t do anything other than bloat your system however it’s a small price to pay for BumpTop though, as it truly is a unique desktop experience.

Getting it isn’t overly easy unfortunately, since Google bought the company ([here’s](http://www.bumptop.com "here's") their website) they have since stopped distributing the software. Don’t worry though, as always I’ve come to the rescue by offering you the app to download below.

Test it out and let me know what you think!  
I also have the pro version, but you’ll need to [contact me](mailto:jason@bayton.org) to get that.

**Download BumpTop here:** [**DOWNLOAD**](/download/BumpTop.rar)
