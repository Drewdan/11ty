Iâ€™ve dedicated over a decade to Android, more than half of that catered towards enterprise. Android has been a passion of mine from my very beginnings in mobile technology; from picking up the original G1 (Dream) and the years of modding and ROM customisations across countless devices, to today building, deploying, and supporting hundreds of thousands of managed Android devices around the globe as an ecosystem Product Leader and Certified Android Enterprise Expert. I've done everything in the Android Enterprise ecosystem except development of the codebase itself (and sales, no thanks).
