I’ve dedicated over a decade to Android, more than half of those years catered towards Android’s use in enterprise. It has more than paid off as today I’m considered to be a leading voice in Android Enterprise across the globe, and have received multiple accolades including for contributions to the Android Enterprise community, Platinum Google Product Expert status in the Android Enterprise Help Community, vExpert status from VMware for Android contributions, and more.

Android has been a passion of mine from my very beginnings in mobile technology; from picking up the original G1 and the years of modding and ROM customisations across countless devices, to today building, deploying, and supporting hundreds of thousands of managed Android devices around the globe as an ecosystem Product Leader and Certified Android Enterprise Expert. Everything I learn I write about here, and I hope my resources help you and your organisation to better understand and support Android in the enterprise, also.
