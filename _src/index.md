I’ve dedicated over a decade to Android, more than half of those catered towards Android’s use in enterprise. It has more than paid off as today I’m considered to be a leading voice in Android Enterprise across the globe, and have received multiple accolades including for contributions to the Android Enterprise, Platinum Product Expert status in the Android Enterprise Help Community, vExpert status from VMware for Android contributions, and more.

Android has been a passion of mine from my very beginnings in technology; from picking up the original G1 to the years of modding and ROM customisations, to today building, deploying, and supporting hundreds of thousands of managed Android devices around the globe as an ecosystem Product Leader and Certified Android Enterprise Expert. Everything I learn I write about here, and I hope my resources help you and your organisation 
to better understand and support Android in the enterprise, also.
