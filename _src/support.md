## Docs

Take a look at [/android](/android), and if you don't see what you're looking for, try [/search](/search). There's a high likelihood your question may have been covered either directly, or indirectly, through existing docs.

If you still don't find what you're looking for, you can [submit a request](https://github.com/jasonbayton/11ty/issues/new?assignees=jasonbayton&labels=documentation&template=content-request.md&title=%5BContent+request%5D) for content and I'll get to it as soon as I'm able.

**Benefit:** 24/7 access, many subjects and FAQs already covered, and if there's something missing it can be requested!

* [Android Enterprise Help Community](https://support.google.com/work/android/community), 
* [MobilePros Slack Community](https://mobilepros.org), 
* [MobilePros Telegram group](https://t.me/mobile_pros).

**Benefit:** As a community resource, your request may be picked up by other members of the community well-versed in the topic at hand. Once a resolution is achieved, the issue and resolution are public domain for others to benefit in kind.

## Email/message

[Email](mailto:jason@bayton.org) me your request and I will respond when able. Please ensure your request is fully-formed, including the issue, any error messages or related information, full device/EMM details, versions, etc, and if you have media to support the issue (pictures, videos, etc), this will be of great help also.

**Benefit:** Private & sensitive topics may be covered. Bug reports and other PII can be shared without making this data publicly available.

## Dedicated engagement

I make available several hours a month for dedicated engagements at the moment, for when the help required goes beyond what can reasonably be achieved through the no-cost options above, 

Ideal for dedicated support, engagements of a strategic/planning nature, or projects of a greater scope or time requirement. Of course, NDA projects also. 

Some examples of dedicated engagements undertaken include:

* EMM migration
* EMM health check
* Mobility strategy planning
* EMM & device selection
* Product consultation on Android Enterprise support for non-Android solutions
* EMM deployment, end to end
* Google Workspace deployment
* GMS consulting for uncertified (AOSP) devices
* Android Enterprise hardware validation


[Email](mailto:jason@bayton.org) me a request for engagement. Include a detailed Scope and/or Statement of Work (SoW) defining your objectives, team involved, main PoC's, as well as a budget and time window for the engagement to review. 

**Fees:** 1/2 day (up to 4h): £650. 1 day (up to 8h): £1200  
NB: Hours may be consumed ad-hoc, across multiple days as required

**Note:** Engagements are subject to availability, depending on the scope and/or time limitations in place. If you have the luxury of time, reach out sooner rather than later to discuss.

**Disclaimers :** 

* Topics discussed may used as the subject or reference of articles on this website (anonymously unless otherwise discussed). 
* For casual help & advice, NDAs and similar documents are out of scope. Share what you are permitted to share, and I'll help as best I can.
* Best effort support is subject to fair use. Please respect this is done in my free time and if we're opening a can of worms together I may call time on the help I can offer.
* I may not be able to respond in a timely fashion at any point during non-dedicated engagements, and make no promises to solve an issue or fully satisfy a need as a casual engagement, but I'll do my best!
