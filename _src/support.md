## ðŸ‘‹ I'm here to help

</div>

Though I aim to provide as much as I can at no - or low - cost, understandably sometimes you need more of a hands-on approach. If you're looking for someone to assist in planning, designing, implementing, or supporting your mobility projects, I can help!

### Buy an hour

Looking for a quick-start on your task at hand? Buy an hour and we can jump on a call to explore the wider scope of your requirements with no obligations to go further. Otherwise, read on below and send me your requirements.

## Consulting engagement

I make available several hours a month for dedicated engagements at the moment, for when the help required goes beyond what can reasonably be achieved through the no-cost options above.

Ideal for dedicated support, engagements of a strategic/planning nature, or projects of a greater scope or time requirement. 

Some examples of dedicated engagements undertaken include:

* EMM migration
* EMM health check
* Mobility strategy planning/review
* EMM & device selection
* Product consultation on Android Enterprise support for new or existing solutions
* EMM deployment, end to end
* Google Workspace deployment
* GMS consulting for uncertified (AOSP) devices
* Android Enterprise hardware validation


[Contact](/contact) me with a request for engagement. Include a detailed Scope and/or Statement of Work (SoW) defining your objectives, team involved, main PoC's, as well as a budget and time window for the engagement to review. 

**Fee options:** 
* 1/2 day (up to 4h)
* Full day (up to 8h)
* Fixed per project

NB: Hours may be consumed ad-hoc, across multiple days as required. 

## Not ready to start?

### Docs

Take a look at [/android](/android), and if you don't see what you're looking for, try [/search](/search). There's a high likelihood your question may have been covered either directly, or indirectly, through existing docs.

If you still don't find what you're looking for, you can [submit a request](https://github.com/jasonbayton/11ty/issues/new?assignees=jasonbayton&labels=documentation&template=content-request.md&title=%5BContent+request%5D) for content and I'll get to it as soon as I'm able.

**Benefit:** 24/7 access, many subjects and FAQs already covered, and if there's something missing it can be requested!
