## Docs

Take a look at [/android](/android), and if you don't see what you're looking for, try [/search](/search). There's a high likelihood your question may have been covered either directly, or indirectly, through existing docs.

If you still don't find what you're looking for, you can [submit a request](https://github.com/jasonbayton/11ty/issues/new?assignees=jasonbayton&labels=documentation&template=content-request.md&title=%5BContent+request%5D) for content and I'll get to it as soon as I'm able.

**Benefit:** 24/7 access, many subjects and FAQs already covered, and if there's something missing it can be requested!

## Dedicated engagement

I make available several hours a month for dedicated engagements at the moment, for when the help required goes beyond what can reasonably be achieved through the no-cost options above.

Ideal for dedicated support, engagements of a strategic/planning nature, or projects of a greater scope or time requirement. 

Some examples of dedicated engagements undertaken include:

* EMM migration
* EMM health check
* Mobility strategy planning
* EMM & device selection
* Product consultation on Android Enterprise support for new or existing solutions
* EMM deployment, end to end
* Google Workspace deployment
* GMS consulting for uncertified (AOSP) devices
* Android Enterprise hardware validation


[Contact](/contact) me with a request for engagement. Include a detailed Scope and/or Statement of Work (SoW) defining your objectives, team involved, main PoC's, as well as a budget and time window for the engagement to review. 

**Fee options:** 
* 1/2 day (up to 4h)
* Full day (up to 8h)
* Fixed per project

NB: Hours may be consumed ad-hoc, across multiple days as required.

**Disclaimers:** 

* Topics discussed may used as the subject or reference of articles on this website. 
* For non-dedicated support, NDAs and similar documents are out of scope. Share what you are permitted to share and I'll help as best I can.
* Non-dedicated support is best-effort. Please respect this is done in my free time and if we're opening a can of worms together I may not be able to dedicate the time needed.
* I may not be able to respond in a timely fashion at any point during non-dedicated engagements, and make no promises to solve an issue or fully satisfy a need as a casual engagement, but I'll do my best!
