## Docs

Take a look at [/android](/android), and if you don't see what you're looking for, try [/search](/search). There's a high likelihood your question may have been covered either directly, or indirectly, through existing docs. Search is full-text, so searching on "work challenge" will bring up all articles referencing it. 

If you still don't find what you're looking for, you can [submit a request](https://github.com/jasonbayton/11ty/issues/new?assignees=jasonbayton&labels=documentation&template=content-request.md&title=%5BContent+request%5D) for content and I'll get to it as soon as I'm able.

**Benefit:** 24/7 access, many subjects and FAQs already covered, and if there's something missing, just request it!

## Community

**Scope:**

* Replies to community-posted topics
* Review of attachments or similar uploaded debugging information

**Benefit:** As a community resource, your request may be picked up by other members of the community well-versed in the topic at hand. Once a resolution is achieved, the issue and resolution are public domain for others to benefit in kind.

**Notes on community support:** 

* Topics discussed may used as the subject of articles on this website. 
* For casual help & advice, NDAs and similar documents are out of scope. Share what you are permitted to share, and I'll help as best I can.
* Best effort support is subject to fair use. Please respect this is done in my free time and if we're opening a can of worms together I may call time on the help I can offer.
* I may not be able to respond in a timely fashion at any point during assistance, and make no promises to solve an issue or fully satisfy a need as a casual engagement, but I'll do my best!

## Dedicated engagement

I make available several hours a month for dedicated engagements at the moment, for when the help required goes beyond what can reasonably be achieved through the no-cost options above, 

Ideal for dedicated support, engagements of a strategic/planning nature, or projects of a greater scope or time requirement. Of course, NDA projects also. 

Some examples of dedicated engagements undertaken include:

* EMM migration. AirWatch to Intune for Android & iOS devices
* Mobility strategy planning for a hardware estate
* Product consultation on Android Enterprise support for non-Android solutions
* EMM & device selection for a greenfield organisation
* Intune deployment, end to end
* Google Workspace advanced management deployment
* EMM health check

[Email](mailto:jason@bayton.org) me a request for engagement. Include a detailed Scope and/or Statement of Work (SoW) defining your objectives, team involved, main PoC's, as well as a budget and time window for the engagement to review. 

**Scope:**

* Dedicated engagement on agreed hours
* Direct access to organisation PoCs & infrastructure for debugging
* RCA & resolution report
* 1-to-1 or 1-to-many remote sessions as required

**Fees:** 1/2 day (up to 4h): £650. 1 day (up to 8h): £1200  
NB: Hours may be consumed ad-hoc, across multiple days as required

**Note:** Engagements are subject to availability, depending on the scope and/or time limitations in place. If you have the luxury of time, reach out sooner rather than later to discuss.
